# The commented values are exemplary, the uncommented values are the default values!


# The directories which should be indexed
directories:
#  - "/my-storage-directory"

# (Optional) Exclude directories / files from the index
#exclusions:
  # Exclusion via a simple string search in the full path of the file / directory.
  # If any of the given strings are found in the full path, it wont be added to the index.
  # Usually faster than a regular expression!
#  partial_paths:
#    - ".DS_Store"
#    - "._.DS_Store"

  # Exclusion via testing if a regular expression matches the full path of the file / directory.
  # If any of the regular expression matches, it wont be added to the index.
  # Usually slower than using a simple string search.
#  regular_expressions:
#    - "\.Trash-\d+"

  # The version of the elasticsearch-library
  # V8 has some pretty big changes, so we need to switch some statements.
